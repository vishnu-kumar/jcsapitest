OpenStack EC2 API README
-----------------------------

Support of EC2 API for OpenStack.
This project provides a standalone EC2 API service which pursues two goals:
 1. Implement VPC API which is now absent in nova's EC2 API
 2. Create a standalone service for EC2 API support which accommodates
not only the VPC API but the rest of the EC2 API currently present in nova as
well.

It doesn't replace existing nova EC2 API service in deployment, it gets
installed to a different port (8788 by default).

Installation
=====

Run install.sh

The EC2 API service gets installed on port 8788 by default. It can be changed
before the installation in install.sh script.

The services afterwards can be started as binaries:

::

 /usr/bin/ec2-api
 /usr/bin/ec2-api-metadata
 /usr/bin/ec2-api-s3

or set up as Linux services.

To configure OpenStack for EC2 API metadata service:

for Nova-network
  add::

    [DEFAULT]
    metadata_port = 8789
    [neutron]
    service_metadata_proxy = True

  to /etc/nova.conf

  then restart nova-metadata (can be run as part of nova-api service) and
  nova-network services.

for Neutron
  add::

    [DEFAULT]
    nova_metadata_port = 8789

  to /etc/neutron/metadata_agent.ini

  then restart neutron-metadata service.

S3 server is intended only to support EC2 operations which require S3 server
(e.g. CreateImage) in OpenStack deployments without regular object storage.
It must not be used as a substitution for all-purposes object storage server.
Do not start it if the deployment has its own object storage or uses a public
one (e.g. AWS S3).

Usage
=====

Download aws cli from Amazon.
Create configuration file for aws cli in your home directory ~/.aws/config:

::

 [default]
 aws_access_key_id = 1b013f18d5ed47ae8ed0fbb8debc036b
 aws_secret_access_key = 9bbc6f270ffd4dfdbe0e896947f41df3
 region = us-east-1

Change the aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_acces_key above to the values
appropriate for your cloud (can be obtained by "keystone ec2-credentials-list"
command).

Run aws cli commands using new EC2 API endpoint URL (can be obtained from
keystone with the new port 8788) like this:

aws --endpoint-url http://10.0.2.15:8788/services/Cloud ec2 describe-instances

Supported Features
==================

EC2 API with VPC API except for the limitations above.

Additions to the legacy nova's EC2 API include:
1. VPC API
2. Filtering
3. Tags

Legacy OpenStack release notice
===============================

EC2 API supports Havana, Icehouse, Juno with additional limitations:


Instance related:
- rootDeviceName Instance property
- kernelId Instance property
- ramdiskId Instance property
- userData Instance property
- hostName Instance property
- reservationId Reservation property (ec2api own ids are generated for
instances launched not by ec2api)
- launchIndex Instance property (0 for instances launched not by ec2api)

Volume related:
- deleteOnTermination property

Network interface related:
- deleteOnTermination (False value can be assigned but doesn't supported)

All these properties can be specified in RunInstance command though, they are
not reported in describe operations.

EC2 API supports Nova client (>=2.16.0) with no microversion support.
Additional limitations are the same, except network interfaces'
deleteOnTermination.

Preferred way to run EC2 API in these releases is to run it in virtual environment:
- create virtual environment by running command 'python tools/install_venv.py'
- run install inside venv 'tools/with_venv.sh ./install.sh'
- and then you need to run EC2 API services: 'ec2-api', 'ec2-api-metadata'
  and 'ec2-api-s3'
Also you need to reconfigure metadata ports in nova(and neutron) config files
if you want metadata to work correctly. (See 'Installation' section).
After these steps you will have working EC2 API services at ports:
8788 for EC2 API and 3334 for S3 API. Don't forget to change keystone endpoints
if you want to run some automated scripts relying on keystone information.
